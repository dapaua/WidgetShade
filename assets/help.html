<strong>Thanks for using WidgetShade! </strong><br>
With WidgetShade you can have your widgets always on hand.
Just use the "+" button , or long press any empty space to add a widget. Long press any widget to move, resize or delete it (by moving it to the top of the screen)<br>
To call WidgetShade you have four options.
<ol>
<li>Tap the app icon.</li>
<li>Tap the notification in the notification bar (can be disabled)</li>
<li>Use the trigger area (can be disabled)</li>
<li>Create a shortcut </li>
</ol>

The trigger area is a white and blue zone that by default appears at the bottom right of your screen, but it can be configured. Tap it or slide your finger over it to activate WidgetShade. In the application settings, you can change the position and size of the trigger area, its visibility, or completely disable it.<br>
The trigger area works as follows: 
<ol>
<li>Horizontal swipe: Show WidgetShade</li>
<li>Vertical swipe: Move trigger. Changes from bottom to top, respecting the configured offset</li>
<li>Long press: Show WidgetShade Settings</li>
</ol>
When the option "Trigger area responds to taps" is enabled, all this functionality is disabled. In this mode, any tap or gesture on the trigger area will start WidgetShade.

<strong>IMPORTANT</strong><br>
To avoid android from closing WidgetShade when it runs out of memory, you have two options. 
<ol>
<li>Enable "Show notification" in the options ; or</li>
<li>Go to Android Settings, then to Accessibility and enable WidgetShade</li>
</ol>
Enabling the accessibility service will prevent WidgetShade from being closed. It will not access any personal information, even if the standard android warning says that it may do that.
<br>
Thanks to all people who gave me suggestions on how to improve WidgetShade, specially James Mostyn, Lindsey Chiew, Perry Farmer, davtse, neuTrue, and all the people from the xda-developers forums.
